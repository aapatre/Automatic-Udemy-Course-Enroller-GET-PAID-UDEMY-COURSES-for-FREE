## Instructions

1 . Make sure to install all the requirements above.

- Run the script and the cli will guide you through the settings required
- Otherwise you can rename the following file
  [sample_settings.yaml](sample_settings.yaml) to **settings.py** and edit it
  using a text editor and insert your **Udemy registered email in the email
  section**, your **Udemy password in the password section**, and the **ZIP Code
  in the zipcode section (if you reside in the United States or any other region
  where Udemy asks for ZIP Code as Billing Info, else enter a random number)**.

2 . Choose the appropriate file for your browser (from the list below):

- **Tested and works perfectly:**

  - Chrome:
    [udemy_enroller_chrome.py](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_chrome.py)
  - Chromium:
    [udemy_enroller_chromium.py](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_chromium.py)
  - Edge:
    [udemy_enroller_edge.py](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_edge.py)

- **Has issues:**

  - Firefox:
    [udemy_enroller_firefox.py(requires manual driver installation)](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_firefox.py)

- **Untested:**

  - Opera:
    [udemy_enroller_opera.py](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_opera.py)

- **Experimentation or other Browsers (especially Safari):**

  - [aka the old bot- requires manual driver setup](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_vanilla.py)

- **Use at your own risk:**
  - Vanilla
  - Internet Explorer:
    [udemy_enroller_internet_explorer.py](https://github.com/aapatre/Automatic-Udemy-Course-Enroller-GET-PAID-UDEMY-COURSES-for-FREE/blob/master/udemy_enroller_internet_explorer.py)

3 . Run the chosen script in terminal like so:
`python udemy_enroller_firefox.py`

4 . The bot starts scraping the course links from the first **All Courses** page
on [Tutorial Bar](https://www.tutorialbar.com/all-courses/page/1) and starts
enrolling you to Udemy courses. After it has enrolled you to courses from the
first page, it then moves to the next Tutorial Bar page and the cycle continues.

- Stop the script by pressing ctrl+c in terminal to stop the enrollment process.

## FAQs

### 1. Can I get a specific course for free with this script?

Unfortunately no, but let me assure you that you may be lucky enough to get a
particular course for free when the instructor posts its coupon code in order
to promote it. Also, over time you would build a library of courses by running
the script often and have all the required courses in your collection. In fact,
I made this course after completing a
[Python automation course](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/) and selenium,
which of course I got for free! :)

### 2. How does the bot work?

The bot retrieves coupon links from Tutorial Bar's list to cut the prices and
then uses Selenium's Browser automation features to login and enroll to the
courses. Think of it this way: Epic Games & other clients like Steam provide you
a handful of games each week, for free; Only in this case, we need a coupon code
to make those courses free.

### 3. How frequently should you run the script?

Daily, at least once! If you are using it for the first time, I recommend that
you allow it to scrape through all pages on Tutorial Bar (might take a few hours
since there are >500 pages on the site). I've painstakingly amassed over 4000
courses in the last four years! And out of those 4000, I've only paid for 4 of
these courses.

So, a mere **0.001%** of courses are **actually paid** in my collection!
Thankfully, you can get more than what I gathered in 4 years, in a matter of
weeks! üôåüèª

### 4. Why did I create this?

It used to be my daily habit to redeem courses and it was an extremely tedious
task that took around 15 minutes, for 10 courses. And then I suddenly got the
idea to automate it, after I found the automation course mentioned above. I bet,
it will save your precious time too! :)

### 5. Udemy has detected that I'm using automation tools to browse the website! What should I do?

![](https://i.imgur.com/pwseilE.jpg) Relax! This happens when you run the script
several times in a short interval of time. Solve the captcha, close the browser,
and simply re-run the script. Easy peasy lemon squeezy! üçãüôÉ <br /><br />

### 6. The code compiles successfully but it's taking too long to work! IS there any way to fix that?

Since we are heavily dependent on a third-party site to retrieve coupons links,
there may be issues when the site is down. Needless to mention the connectivity
issues too. If everything is working fine, you can see the courses being
retrieved in the Python console/shell, which may take a while.

### 7. Which is the best way to run the script?

It is recommended to run the script using Python's IDLE IDE.

**Pro-tip:** Create a batch file, to launch the script instantly, using these
instructions: https://datatofish.com/batch-python-script/

### 8. Which branch to commit against?

Pull request should be made on "develop" branch.
