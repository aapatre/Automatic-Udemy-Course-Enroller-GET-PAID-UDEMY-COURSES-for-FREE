```

**Total: 58 working Udemy course links**

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. IDownloadCoupon Scraper
**Problem:** Site changed from using `murl` query parameters to 302 redirects through linksynergy (DNS-blocked domain)

**Solution:** Capture 302 redirect Location headers without following them
```python
# Don't follow redirects - capture the Location header
async with session.get(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=False) as response:
    if response.status in [301, 302, 303, 307, 308]:
        location = response.headers.get('Location', '')
        # Extract murl parameter from Location header
        if "murl=" in location:
            murl_match = re.search(r'[?&]murl=([^&]+)', location)
            if murl_match:
                decoded_url = urllib.parse.unquote(murl_match.group(1))
```

**Result:** Successfully extracts 15 course links by bypassing DNS blocking

### 2. FreebiesGlobal Scraper  
**Problem:** Website restructured - URL path changed from `/dealstore/udemy/` to `/shop/udemy/`

**Solution:** Updated URL paths and simplified validation
```python
# Old: f"{self.DOMAIN}/dealstore/udemy/"
# New: f"{self.DOMAIN}/shop/udemy/"

# Simplified validation using base class method
for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
    validated_url = cls.validate_coupon_url(link.get("href", ""))
    if validated_url:
        return validated_url
```

**Result:** Successfully finds 31 course links

### 3. CourseVania Scraper
**Problem:** Site changed CSS classes from `stm-lms-buy-buttons` to `masterstudy-button-affiliate`

**Solution:** Added multiple fallback selectors
```python
# Try multiple selectors in order
buy_buttons_div = soup.find("div", class_="stm-lms-buy-buttons")
if buy_buttons_div:
    # ... check for link

# Try new selector
affiliate_button = soup.find("div", class_="masterstudy-button-affiliate")
if affiliate_button:
    # ... check for link

# Fallback: check all links
for link in soup.find_all("a", href=True):
    validated = cls.validate_coupon_url(link.get("href", ""))
    if validated:
        return validated
```

**Result:** Successfully finds 12 course links

### 4. TutorialBar Scraper
**Problem:** Site is blocked by Cloudflare (522 error)

**Solution:** Added defensive null checks to prevent crashes
```python
# Safe extraction with null checks
course_links = []
for link in links:
    anchor = link.find("a")
    if anchor and anchor.get("href"):
        course_links.append(anchor.get("href"))
```

**Result:** Prevents crashes but site remains inaccessible (Cloudflare protection)

## Technical Improvements

1. **Consistent URL Validation**: All scrapers now use the base class `validate_coupon_url()` method
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added null checks and fallback mechanisms
3. **Redirect Handling**: Implemented 302 redirect capture for sites using tracking domains
4. **Multiple Selector Support**: Added fallback selectors for changing site structures

## Testing

Test script available at `test_all_scrapers.py`:
```python
python test_all_scrapers.py
```

This will test all scrapers and show the number of links found by each.

## Impact

- **58 Udemy course links** are now accessible that were previously returning 0
- **3 out of 4 scrapers** fully restored to working condition
- **Improved resilience** against future website changes with fallback mechanisms
- **Better error handling** prevents crashes even when sites change
